# react-composition-examples
Examples for different composition patterns in React.

Each pattern is implemented using storybook stories, which can be found under `stories/`. You can run the example locally by cloning this repository and running storybook.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/viglucci/react-composition-examples.git
$ cd react-composition-examples
$ npm install && npm run storybook
```
